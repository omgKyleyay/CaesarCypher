# CaesarCypher
Caesar Encryption Program.
This program will encrypt any text file you want by shifting each character to n characters right- where n is a key of your choice.
Use a key of 0 to see the original text.
Place your text file in the main project folder path, and rename it to "ciphered.txt" 
It also features the ability to let you try and undo the encryption manually- for testing purposes.
